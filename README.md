# FroggoCutter 🐸

Yo, what's up my froggylovers! 👋

Have you ever struggled to create a custom login background for your server? It's a real pain in the butt, isn't it? Images come out all stretched or just plain ugly beacuse of aspect ratio. But fear not, my friends, FroggoCutter is here to save the day! 🐸🎉

With FroggoCutter, you can easily slice your image into 12 pieces and save them as high-quality BMP files. And if you're looking to save some space, you can choose to save the files as 8-bit. Plus, you have the option to select the desired algorithm to create the color palette.

### So Basically

- The BMP files are named in a specific format, so you don't have to worry about renaming them yourself.
- The 12 files are compressed into a zip file for easy downloading.
- If you wanna save some MBs you can choose to use the 8-bit option.

### To Do

- [ ] Support for t_login.jpg output, for newer clients

### Known Issues:

If you try to slice a big image (>3000px) and 8Bit is selected, your browser might lock itself for a few seconds (❁´◡\`❁).\
So just be patient, all righty?
