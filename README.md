This is a simple website for creating a custom login background for your Ragnarok client. It slices your image into 12 pieces by default and saves the BMP files as 24-bit, which produces good quality images.

Alternatively, you can choose to save the files as 8-bit to save space. When 8Bit is activated you can select the desired algorithm to create the color palette.

The BMP files are named with this format `t_¹è°æX-Y.bmp` and are compressed into a zip file for the user to download.

Known Issues:

- When you try to slice a big image (>3000px) and 8Bit is selected, the browser may lock itself for a few seconds (❁´◡\`❁)
