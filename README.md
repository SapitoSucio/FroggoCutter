# FroggoCutter 🐸

Yo, what's up my froggylovers! 👋

Have you ever struggled to create a custom login background for your server? It's a real pain in the butt, isn't it? Images come out all stretched or just plain ugly beacuse of aspect ratio. But fear not, my friends, FroggoCutter is here to save the day! 🐸🎉

With FroggoCutter, you can easily slice your image into 12 pieces and save them as high-quality BMP files. And if you're looking to save some space, you can choose to save the files as 8-bit. Plus, you have the option to select the desired algorithm to create the color palette.

So Basically

- The BMP files are named in a specific format, so you don't have to worry about organizing them yourself.
- The 12 files are compressed into a zip file for easy downloading.
- It's super simple to use, even if you're not a tech-savvy person.
- If you wanna save some good MBs you can  choose to use the 8-bit option.

Known Issues:

If you try to slice a big image (>3000px) and 8Bit is selected, your browser might lock itself for a few seconds (❁´◡\`❁).\
So just be patient, all righty?
