This is a simple site to create your login background, slicing your image into 12 pieces for your ragnarok client. 

By default, it saves the BMP files as 24bit,
you can also choose to save it as 8bit, also allows you
to choose the desired algorithm to create the color pallete


Known Issues:

When you try to slice a big image (>3000px) and 8Bit is selected, the browser may lock itself for a few seconds (❁´◡`❁)
